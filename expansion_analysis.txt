#1 read-in hypotheses to define interesting questions
#	-> but do this via Snakefile (not hypothesis read-in in as dataframe, etc. in R!) so to perform hypothesis in parallel!
#2 perform filtering of Orthogroups and retain "expanded" (criteria? what about 0s etc.?)
#	->there is no reason to perform the same OG analysis twice but this is misleading; BLAST etc. is different depeding on the
#	species that are part of the analysis even if the same OG is looked at!
#		-> this makes it easier as each hypotheses HAS to be looked at seperately and there is no point to look for overlap
#3 for each OG retained in each hypothesis perform BLAST filtering and retain specific amount of genes
#	-> now here I need to come up with sth. since the sizes of the OGs (can) vary immensely!
#	-> some ideas: min size of final set for trees = 60; number of final set needs to be double(?) of that of initial OG
#4 construct trees
#5 visualize trees with Rshiny (!! ggtree - can group an colour ;D)

#6 add expression information based on DESeq2 analysis (perhaps add a significance flag to dataframe of expression values?)
#7 tree ranking perhaps based on size of expansion + Gene Ontology Analysis ()
#8 Gene Ontology based GSEA can also be part of the Rshiny output


#retention of other data for the trees? 
#further annotation or colouring somehow?

#in the end nice features like gene lookup or export of tables or subsets
