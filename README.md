# A2TEA
Automated Assessment of Trait specific Evolutionary Adaptations

This workflow combines RNA-seq analyses based on our RAW-ABS pipeline with evolutionary analyses - most notably gene family expansion events.
We use Orthofinder2 to infer gene duplication events and correlate these with significant physiological reaction patterns in the compared species.

Transcriptome assemblies -> AHRD annotation also possible...
