### STAR
## default parameters change these to your specific needs

##change STAR's --sjdbOverhang option; ideal value here is read_length-1
##e.g.: 2x100b paired-end reads, the ideal value is 100-1=99; varying length? then, do this with the max length

read_length_star_index: 99


## parameters when running usual pipeline ##
## option --genomeLoad NoShared memory will load into memory the whole index on each mapping run and delete it after the mapping ##
## with big genomes this is VERY memory intensive! e.g. the index for barley is ~ 40 Gb - so keep this in mind when setting the amount of paralelisation ##
## for example with 24 cores specified and a 6 threads per STAR align job: 24/6 = 4; 4 x 40 Gb ~ around 160  Gb of memory required! ##
## you can change the --genomeLoad parameter to other options e.g. keeping in memory one index for all mappings - however this can't be used in conjunction with 2-PASS mapping ##
## also removal of the index from memory would require an additional rule or manual removal via ipcs/ipcrm after everything is finished -- might change this in the future.. ##

## try automatic filtering for longest isoform of fastas?
## -> very stable for standard fasta files from e.g. Ensembl, NCBI, etc.
## when not set to "YES", we assume you performed appropiate filtering yourself
### if you perform the filtering yourself take care to have the fasta headers for a gene/protein to be the simple gene identifier (no .1; .p3; etc.)
### this is important since for the differential expression analysis we use tximport to reduce the cdna based quantification with kallisto to gene level,
### and association between orthology and expression analysis is the purpose of this software

## use chunks for blasting?
## coreutils split - is sometimes not easy to install
## defaulit is ON and allows faster runtime - if problems occur set to OFF

## options for expansion analyses

# define the expansion factor, e.g. 2 -> expanded species has to have 2-times the genes for the HOG to be considered "expanded"
# <- use this explanation somewhere more appropiate

# define the max number of additional best blast hits to include in the follow-up analyses
# tree visualizations often are more informative if we use more than an individual (H)OG

# FDR cutoff for significance if differential gene expresssion analysis
